## TTL Serial Control

The control board mounted on the base of the xArm has a 4-pin connector which provides a signal path and power to an external host controller.

| Pin | Description
|-----|------------
| GND | Power and signal ground.
| TX  | Serial TTL signal from xArm to host controller. Mark = 5VDC, Space = 0VDC.
| RX  | - Serial TTL signal from host controller to xArm. Mark = 5VDC, Space = 0VDC.
| 5V  | 5 Volts DC power for eternal host controller. Current rating is not yet known. In most circumstances this is left unconnected.<br>`Warning: Do not connect to an external power source. Doing so will cause the xArm to beep loudly and may damage the control board.`
