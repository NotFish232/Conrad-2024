This is a very basic example using Visual Basic and tests connectivity by reading battery voltage and homing all servos for the xArm only.

Create a VB solution and copy Module1.vb code to the new project.

Connect xArm to PC using a USB Serial TTL adapter.
  
Run the code. The code will list available COM ports and prompt for the port the xArm is connected to. Then the battery voltage is displayed. Press ENTER when prompted to home all servos.
